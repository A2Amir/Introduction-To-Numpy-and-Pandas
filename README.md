# Introduction To Numpy and Pandas
 

<h2> 1. Introduction to NumPy</h1>


NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently. Thes lesson is intended as a basic overview of NumPy and introduces some of its most important features.

In the following lessons you will learn:

<h2> 2. Introduction to Pandas</h1>

Pandas is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The name Pandas is derived from the econometrics term Panel Data. Pandas incorporates two additional data structures into Python, namely Pandas Series and Pandas DataFrame. These data structures allow us to work with labeled and relational data in an easy and intuitive manner. These sections are intended as a basic overview of Pandas and introduces some of its most important features.

he following sections assume that you are already familiar with NumPy and have gone over the previous NumPy sections. In the following you will learn:
