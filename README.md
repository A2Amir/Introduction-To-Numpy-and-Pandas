# Introduction To Numpy and Pandas
 

<h2> 1. Introduction to NumPy</h1>


NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently. Thes lesson is intended as a basic overview of NumPy and introduces some of its most important features.
