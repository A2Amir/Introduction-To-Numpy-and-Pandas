For instance, you might use an ndarray to hold the pixel values of an image that will be fed into a Neural Network for image classification.\n",

For example, the shape of a rank 2 array will correspond to the number of rows and columns of the array. As you will see, NumPy ndarrays have attributes that allow us to get information about them in a very intuitive way. For example, the shape of an ndarray can be obtained using the **.shape** attribute. The shape attribute returns a tuple of N positive integers that specify the sizes of each dimension. In the example below we will create a rank 1 array and learn how to obtain its shape, its type, and the data-type (dtype) of its elements."
