You can check which version of Pandas you have by typing **!conda list pandas** in your Jupyter notebook or by typing **conda list pandas** in the Anaconda prompt. If you have another version of Pandas installed in your computer, you can update your version by typing **conda install pandas=0.22** in the Anaconda prompt. As newer versions of Pandas are released, some functions may become obsolete or replaced, so make sure you have the correct Pandas version before running the code. This will guarantee your code will run smoothly. "

    "### Why Use Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent success of machine learning algorithms is partly due to the huge amounts of data that we have available to train our algorithms on. However, when it comes to data, quantity is not the only thing that matters, the quality of your data is just as important. It often happens that large datasets don’t come ready to be fed into your learning algorithms. More often than not, large datasets will often have missing values, outliers, incorrect values, etc… Having data with a lot of missing or bad values, for example, is not going to allow your machine learning algorithms to perform well. Therefore, one very important step in machine learning is to look at your data first and make sure it is well suited for your training algorithm by doing some basic data analysis. This is where Pandas come in. Pandas Series and DataFrames are designed for fast data analysis and manipulation, as well as being flexible and easy to use. Below are just a few features that makes Pandas an excellent package for data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Allows the use of labels for rows and columns\n",
    "   * Can calculate rolling statistics on time series data\n",
    "   * Easy handling of NaN values\n",
    "   * Is able to load data of different formats into DataFrames\n",
    "   * Can join and merge different datasets together\n",
    "   * It integrates with NumPy and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "For these and other reasons, Pandas DataFrames have become one of the most commonly used Pandas object for data analysis in Python.\n"

One of the main differences between Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays is that you can assign an index label to each element in the Pandas Series. In other words, you can name the indices of your Pandas Series anything you want. Another big difference between Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays is that Pandas Series can hold data of different data types.\n",
