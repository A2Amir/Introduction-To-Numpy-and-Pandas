    "Up to now we have seen how to make slices and select elements of an ndarray using indices. This is useful when we know the exact indices of the elements we want to select. However, there are many situations in which we don't know the indices of the elements we want to select. For example, suppose we have a 10,000 x 10,000 ndarray of random integers ranging from 1 to 15,000 and we only want to select those integers that are less than 20. Boolean indexing can help us in these cases, by allowing us select elements using logical arguments instead of explicit indices. Let's see some examples:"
