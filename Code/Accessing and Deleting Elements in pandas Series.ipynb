    "Now let's look at how we can access or modify elements in a Pandas Series. One great advantage of Pandas Series is that it allows us to access data **in many different ways**. Elements can be accessed using **index labels or numerical indices inside square brackets, [ ],** similar to how we access elements in NumPy ndarrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can use numerical indices, we can use both positive and negative integers to access data from the beginning or from the end of the Series, respectively. Since we can access elements in various ways, in order to remove any ambiguity to whether we are referring to an index label or numerical index, Pandas Series have two attributes, **.loc** and **.iloc** to explicitly state what we mean. The attribute **.loc stands for location** and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a labeled index. Similarly, the attribute **.iloc stands for integer location** and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a numerical index. Let's see some examples:"
